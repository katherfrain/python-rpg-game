You are a Gremlin, frolicking in the chaos amidst
the living books clattering on the shelves of the 
Library. Normally, everything is a delight - tearing
ancient pages out of ancient texts, mistranslating
old peace entreaties - but now something is wrong in
the East Corridor. Smoke belches under the door, and
the books inside are glowing the wrong color.

At least, you think it's the books. Something is glowing
in there, and you're not going to check it out.

Unless you are. Do you:
[1] leave a note for the Janitor and otherwise ignore it?
[2] creep into the East Corridor.
