In the desert you see a turtle flipped over on its back.
It's struggling. Can't turn itself over. The heat is setting in.
Do you: 
[1] take the turtle as a pet.
[2] you must mean a tortoise - what is a turtle doing in the desert?
[3] kick it over so it doesn't pee on you.

There are three white foxes on a red sand dune. 
One of them always lies, one tells the truth, and one only sits there
and bleeds from his eyes. Which one do you offer meat?
[1] to the Watcher I give this offering.
[2] to the Speaker I give this offering.
[3] to the Liar I give this offering.
~
What lie do you tell yourself? 
[1] the world will continue like this.
[2] good intentions are enough.
[3] there's nothing after this.
