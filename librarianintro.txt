Most people wouldn't dare try Summoning, you know.

On the table in front of you are three bubbling potions.
The violet one reeks of sulfur and mustard.
The green one smells like mint and something - something 
that makes your head oddly fuzzy. 
The blue one smells like camphor and old wine.

You've drawn the runes on the floor precisely, and meditated
for forty days and nights. Now, according to the Ancient Tome,
it's time to drink one of the potions. Do you drink:

[1] the violet one
[2] the green one
[3] the blue one
