"Ah, Janitor. Good to see you," says the 
Librarian. She's twiddling with a glass beaker
filled with what looks like viscous starlight.
"Is this about the East Corridor?"

"Nah, about the Southern Castle."

She relaxes.

"Bloody - of course it's about the East Corridor.
What's *in* there?"

The Librarian sighs. "I'm afraid just telling you
would make more of it. Look, take this."
She holds out a sword.

Do you:

[1] Take the Vorpal Sword?
[2] Tell the Librarian you can do it alone.
